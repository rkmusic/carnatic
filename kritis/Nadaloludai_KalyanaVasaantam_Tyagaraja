Meaning:
O Mind! By becoming a lover of nada, attain the eternal bliss. By total involvement in that music through countless ragas which result by the manipulation of the seven notes of music and which fulfills all the righteous desires. Know that it is by this experience of nada that the trinity -Indra, Ganesha and Subrahmanya and other personages had done upasana. Tyagaraja is aware of this.
