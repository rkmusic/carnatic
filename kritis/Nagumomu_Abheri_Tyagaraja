Meaning:
O RAma! Supreme among Raghus! Missing your charming smile-lit face, I languish here. Knowing my mental plight, can't you come and protect me? O One who holds the GOvardhana Hill! Members of your retinue who have the duty of reminding you of your daily engagements cannot fail in their duty. Does not Garuda execute your commands expeditiously? Could he have excused himself saying that he was staying far from the earth in VaikuNTha, your heavenly above? Exalted Lord! Ruler of the Universe! To whom else can I appeal? Please do not disregard me, I can't bear it. Take me into your fold.
