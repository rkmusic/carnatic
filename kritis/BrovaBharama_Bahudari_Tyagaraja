Meaning:
Oh Karunaakaraa (a name for Vishnu), is it a heavy burden for you to protect a single soul like me? You are the whole universe itself and as Krishna showed it all to be in your stomach. Have you not lovingly borne for the sake of the Devas the whole weight of Mount Mandara when the ocean was churned, and have you not lifted Mount Govardhan for the sake of Gopis?
