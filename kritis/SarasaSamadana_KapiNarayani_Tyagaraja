Meaning:
Oh Rama! You are the One who knows how to use the saama, daana, bEdha and danDa methods at the appropriate time. No one can be compared to you. Please help me. RaavaNa, the most devoted bhaktha (devotee) of Lord Shiva, could not understand this truth. You sent many calming words to him through your messenger. You even granted Ayodhya to RaavaNa. Finally, you conquered him and made his brother Vibheeshana the king of Lanka.
