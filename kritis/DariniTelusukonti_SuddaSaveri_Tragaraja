Meaning:
O Merciful goddess! Sister of my Sri Rama! I have now known the way to salvation and have sought refuge in you alone. I have learned the path by following which Brahma, Indra and other godes and devotees have reached the coean of eternal Bliss and swum in it. I have found in you the Protector of the distressed and the fulfiller of the desires of those who have faith in you. You are the Mother who confers inestimable prosperity and wealth, who protects devotees, destroying the wilderness of their past Karma. I have now understood how great sages of the world, by the glory of your grace, have freed themselves from the bondage of worldliness and attained eternal bliss. That I have been privileged to witness your Friday worship is due to my past lives' merits. I have learned why great men consider your Japam alone throughout one's life the way to salvation.
