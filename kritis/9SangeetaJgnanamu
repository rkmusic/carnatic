Meaning:
O Mind, mere knowledge of music without devotion can never lead to the right path. Lord Nataraaja, Anjaneeya, sages like Brungi, Agastya, Maatanga and Naarada worship you through music, saturated with devotion. Is there a supreme mode of worship? TyAgarAja knows how to discriminate right and wrong. He is also aware that this world is unreal and transient. He has found the way to conquer the six inward enemies like lust, attachment, anger etc. Yet he is fully convinced that there is no other way to salvation than knowledge of music integrated with unalloyed devotion.

Meaning: (From TK Govinda Rao’s Book)

P: O Mind (“Manasa”)! Mere knowledge (“gnyanamu”) of music (“sangeetha”) without (“vinaa”) devotion (“bhakthi”) can never lead (“galadhe”) to the right (“san”) path (“maargamu”).

 

A: Lord Nataraaja (“natesha”), Anjaneeya (son of the wind -- “sameer” “aja”), sages like Brungi, Agastya (“ghatajaa -- born from a pot”), Maatanga and Naarada worship you through music (“simche”), saturated with devotion. Is there a supreme mode of worship?

 

C: Tyagaraaja knows how(“delusunu”)  to discriminate right (“Nyaya Nyamu”) and wrong (“durguna”). He is also aware that this world (“jagamulu”) is unreal and transient (“mayamayamane”). He has found the way to conquer (“jayinche”) the six (“shad”) inward enemies (“ripula”) like lust, attachment, anger (“kaayajaadi”) etc. … beginning with (Adi) kAma (kAyaja) (literally cupid) (kAyajAdi) (kAma, krOdha, lObha, mOha, mada and mAtsarya) … Yet he is fully convinced that there is no other way to salvation than knowledge of music (“kaaryamu delusunu”) integrated with unalloyed devotion.
