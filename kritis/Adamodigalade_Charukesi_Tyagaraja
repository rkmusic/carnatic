Meaning: O Ramayya! You seem to feel too proud, too uppish, even to talk to me. I have sought you as my sole support and shelter and stuck to you steadfastly and devotedly but you seem to feel .. Do you remember that when kindly Anjaneya, an offshoot of Shiva Himself, at his very first meeting with you desired to be informed of your antecedents, you did not respond directly, but commanded Lakshmana to speak to him? When such was the lot of Anjaneya himself, who can expect you to talk to this frail Tyagaraja?
