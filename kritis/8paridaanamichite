Meaning (Approximate!)

O Lord Venkateshwara! Maybe ("emo") you will protect me ("palintu") if I give ("icchithe") you some charity ("pari-dhaana")?

O Supreme ("parama") being ("purushaa")! O husband ("pati") of Lakshmi ("sri")!

What ("emaiyya") is the reason ("yunna - kaarana") why you ("neeku") do not give ("galgaga") me ("naapai") your grace ("karuna") ?

I am not ("gaanu") the friend ("cheli") of Lord Shiva ("mukkanti") {reference to Kubera, Lord of Wealth} to give you ("icchutaku") money ("rokkam").

I am not ("gaanu") King ("raaju") Janaka to be able to give ("nosaga") a beautiful daughter ("chakkani cheli") like Seetha in marriage to you.

I am not Markatendra ("Markatendrudu") to be able to give you  ("ivva") even a small portion ("mikkini") of an army ("sainya").

What can I give you ("neeku"), O Lord Adi Venkateshwara, to attain ("galgu") your grace ("aggadigamedu")?
