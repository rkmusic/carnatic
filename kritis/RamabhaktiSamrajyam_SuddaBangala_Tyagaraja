Meaning:s
O Mind! Who are the blessed souls who have attained the Kingdom of devotion for SrI RAma? The mere sight of those sublime souls who have been blessed with the kingdom of devotion to RAma is capable of conferring Supreme Bliss, here and hereafter. This Bliss is beyond words. It can only be experienced by those who endear themselves to Him by unswerving devotion to Him. He has created the three worlds for His diversion.
