Meaning:
Oh Lord you are an opportunist, You deceived your parents Devaki , Vasudeva as also the gopikas who surrendered to you, You mischievously smile when Yashoda innocently folded you with love at the thought that she too would be disappointed on being separated from him, You falsified the aforesaid words of Sruti and Smruti. You have somehow not come to me despite the fact that I was overjoyed in keeping your memory always in my heart, You preached patience, tolerance in the face of adversity freedom from anger, satsang etc; and coolly accepted my pujas, You give bhakti and peace, Despite all this you have steadfastly not come closer to me to the end, Thus this kirthana, a gem amongst the five kirthanas which bring out the thought and reminiscences of Shri Thayagaraja; is a great gift to the singer and bhaktas .

pallavi: Oh Mind!! He has achieved his objective
anupallavi: He has, by being steadfast, falsified his own preachings of the guiding light of Geetha, given to the world by himself.
caraNam (0): Oh! He has spoken according to the time and place!
caraNam 1: Just like the tormenting (deceiving) of Devaki and Vasudeva
caraNam 2: One who is brave in this world stage; father of the sacred Ganges; Totally devoted to classical music from birth to youth
caraNam 3: One who, unable to fulfil the wishes of shepherdess teased them.
caraNam 4: You are the paramathma who charmed the shepherd women and made them worship you. Not only that, your are the Hari who mischievously smiled when innocent Yashoda kissed you thing that you were her child.
caraNam 5: Oh Hari! You show immense love to your great devotees, You are an ocean of good qualities without any sin, I am nurturing in my lotus heart the fond hope that you will remove the problems of Kaliyuga, throughout the lifespan. Oh lord, I fondly seek you, while I am thus singing your praise.
caraNam 6: Oh Hari! Ramachandra!! The lord of Raghuvamsha!! Possessor of nectar like sweet tongue! The lord who is reposes on the seshanaga; one who is like a brother to otherÂ’s wives; one who is worshipped by emperors; one who has clean and healthy body; one who has lotus petal like eyes.
caraNam 7: Oh Lord of Tirupati!! Self-Illuminating! The greatest of great! Dweller in the hearts of good people! Adorner of Pithambara; the lord who shines with shining mane and earrings. Thus this worshipper of yours sings the praise of the king of human race Shri Ramachandra.
caraNa shEsham: Oh Rama! The lord who prescribed and identified the mark of a good man! You patiently waited and accepted my worship. You asked me not to be angry. You thought me that I should not mix with those who do not love god. You thought me to be patient in the face of adversity, You gave the virtue of controlling the senses and meditating peacefully. Desprite all this your are yet to come to this worshipper of your Shri Thyagaraja.
