She who is of the form of the fifty Pithas, please protect me, oh Rajarajeshvari.

She who is of the form of the fifteen-syllabled mantra, is the daughter of King Pandya, is the sister of Vishnu, she is benevolent.

Oh Devi, Mother of the universe, of the nature of consciousness, is the mother of Guruguha, and is worshipped by celestials. She is the cause of time and space, and delights the heart of Mahadeva. She is the spotless one, pleased with Raga Devagandhara. She is the embodiment of Bhava, Raga, and Tala. Beloved of the devotees, she bestows great boons on them.
