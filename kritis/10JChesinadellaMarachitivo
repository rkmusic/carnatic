Meaning:
Rama! In spite of my devotion to you, in order to torment me deliberately, you seem to have conveniently forgotten all that you have done for your devotees. On behalf of your consort and devotee, Sita Devi, you promptly befriended and entered into a pact with Sugriva. To honor your word to Vibhishana, you directed Lakshmana to crown him sovereign of Lanka in anticipation. To honor Anjaneya for executing the onerous task of carrying your message to Sita Devi and bring back hers, you conferred on him the celestial status of Brahma.
