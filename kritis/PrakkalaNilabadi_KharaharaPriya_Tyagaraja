Meaning:
What is the secret of the service by which , standing on either side, you both delight the Lord immensely? O maother Sita, how charming you are with your face rivalling the moon's in splendour, and with teeth like chioce pearls in fine array! O Lakshmana! The most ardent servant of the Lord! Do you prostrate before Him or sing His praises and glory chanting the divine name or lose yourselves in meditating on Him? Do me the favour of revealing the secret so that I may follow suit and redeem myself.
