Meaning:
Oh One who is unique among all the Raghus! I will never release your lotus feet. Who but you can rid me of the accumulated sins and offer me shelter? Mundane life (the ocean of samsaara) is replate with trials and tribulations. To cross this vale of sorrow, I have come to you. O Lord of Seeta! Protector of those seeking refuge! Bestower of joy!
