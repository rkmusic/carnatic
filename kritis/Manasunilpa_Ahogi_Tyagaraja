Meaning:
If one is not capable of controlling his mind, of what avail will be his showy worship with flowers and dulcet bells? How can a bath in the holy river KAveri or GaNga purify one, if he is puffed up with haughtiness and self-conceit? If the wife of a SOmayAji indulges in illicit love, will his SOmayAga befit him to the Heavenly abode? No amount of austerity can confer spiritual merit on a man if he is given to lust and anger. Please enlighten me, Lord!
